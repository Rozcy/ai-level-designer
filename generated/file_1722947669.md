Here's an example of a Markdown code snippet for a feature in the `ai-level-designer` repository:

**Feature: Neural Network Architecture Visualization**
=============================================

### Description
----------------

This feature allows users to visualize their neural network architecture in a graphical representation, making it easier to understand and debug complex networks.

### Code
------

```python
# ai_level_designer/neural_network.py

import networkx as nx
from ai_level_designer import NeuralNetwork

class NeuralNetworkVisualizer:
    """
    A class for visualizing neural network architectures.
    
    Attributes:
        network (NeuralNetwork): The neural network to visualize.
        
    Methods:
        visualize: Generate a graphical representation of the network.
    """

    def __init__(self, network):
        self.network = network

    def visualize(self):
        """
        Generate a graph using NetworkX and draw it with Matplotlib.
        
        Returns:
            matplotlib.figure.Figure: The generated figure.
        """
        # Create a directed graph
        G = nx.DiGraph()
        
        # Add nodes for each layer
        layers = self.network.layers
        for i, layer in enumerate(layers):
            G.add_node(i, label=layer.name)
        
        # Add edges between layers
        for i, layer in enumerate(layers[:-1]):
            next_layer = layers[i+1]
            G.add_edge(i, i+1, weight=self._calculate_edge_weight(layer, next_layer))
        
        # Draw the graph
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
        nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=5000, node_color='lightblue')
        nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=12)
        nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, width=2, edge_color='gray')
        
        return plt.gcf()

    def _calculate_edge_weight(self, layer1, layer2):
        """
        Calculate the weight of an edge between two layers.
        
        This is a placeholder method and should be implemented according to your specific use case.
        
        Args:
            layer1 (Layer): The first layer.
            layer2 (Layer): The second layer.
        
        Returns:
            float: The edge weight.
        """
        # TO DO: implement your own logic here
        return 0.5
