Here is a Markdown code snippet for a feature in the `ai-level-designer` repository:

**Feature: Neural Network Architecture Auto-Completion**
=============================================

### Description
Auto-complete neural network architecture design by suggesting connections between layers.

### Code
```markdown
# ai_level_designer/features/neural_network_architecture_auto_completion.py

"""
This module provides a feature to auto-complete neural network architecture design.
It uses a pre-trained graph neural network model to suggest connections between layers.
"""

from ai_level_designer.models import NeuralNetworkModel
from ai_level_designer.utils import generate_random_layer_name, get_layer_connection_matrix

def auto_complete_neural_network_architecture(neural_network_model: NeuralNetworkModel) -> dict:
    """
    Auto-complete neural network architecture design by suggesting connections between layers.

    Args:
        neural_network_model (NeuralNetworkModel): The neural network model to complete.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the completed neural network architecture.

    layer_connection_matrix = get_layer_connection_matrix(neural_network_model)

    # Generate a random number of new connections to add

            layer2_name = generate_random_layer_name(neural_network_model.layers)

```

### Example Use Case

To use this feature, you can import the `auto_complete_neural_network_architecture` function and call it with a `NeuralNetworkModel` instance:
```python
from ai_level_designer.models import NeuralNetworkModel
from ai_level_designer.features.neural_network_architecture_auto_completion import auto_complete_neural_network_architecture

# Create a new neural network model
model = NeuralNetworkModel()

# Auto-complete the neural network architecture
completed_model = auto_complete_neural
